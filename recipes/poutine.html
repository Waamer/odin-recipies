    <p>Poutine is a Québécois dish made of fresh-cut french fries topped with cheese curds and gravy. 
    It first appeared in 1950s rural Quebec snack bars. It was widely popularized across Canada and beyond in the 1990s</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 (10.25 ounce) can beef gravy</li>
        <li>5 medium potatoes, cut into fries</li>
        <li>2 cups cheese curds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C)</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, begin to warm gravy.</li>
        <li>Place fries into the hot oil, and cook until light brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Cook fries in batches if necessary to allow them room to move a little in the oil. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain</li>
        <li>Place fries on a serving platter, and sprinkle cheese over them. Ladle warmed gravy over the fries and cheese, and serve immediately</li>
    </ol>
